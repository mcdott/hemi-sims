            Hemianopsia, also known as hemianopia, is a visual impairment that
            affects millions of people worldwide. It is a complex condition that
            can be challenging to understand, but knowing more about it can help
            improve the lives of those affected, hence the simulations above.

            What is Hemianopsia?
          </h2>
          <p className='text-lg mb-4'>
            Hemianopsia is a vision impairment characterized by the loss of half
            the field of vision in one or both eyes. It can occur in different
            forms, such as homonymous hemianopsia, where the same side of the
            visual field is affected in both eyes, or heteronymous hemianopsia,
            where the opposite sides of the visual field are affected.
            Hemianopsia can significantly impact a person's daily life, making
            tasks like reading, driving, and navigating through spaces more
            difficult.

              Stroke: A stroke occurs when the blood supply to a part of the
              brain is interrupted or reduced. This can lead to cell death in
              the affected area and may result in hemianopsia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Brain injury: Traumatic brain injuries, such as those sustained in
              accidents or falls, can cause damage to the brain's visual pathway
              and lead to hemianopsia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tumors: Brain tumors, both malignant and benign, can cause
              hemianopsia if they press on or damage the visual pathway.
            </li>
            <li>
              Neurological disorders: Certain neurological disorders, such as
              multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, can cause damage to the brain's
              visual pathway and lead to hemianopsia.
